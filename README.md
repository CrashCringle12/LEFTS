# Overview

Since U.P.S is not happening this year, we will be holding R.I.G.H.T.S instead! It's more or less the same thing, even at the same location, but we are now running ITGMania (which is more or less the same as SM5).

We are presently running ITGMania on our cab. Information about ITGMania can be found [HERE](https://www.itgmania.com/). If you're unfamiliar with ITGMania, for the purposes of this tournament it is interchangeable with SM5. **YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION ABOUT THIS IN THE POST BELOW.**

The purpose of the U.P.S and D.O.W.N.S. tournament series was to create a casual, inclusive environment that maximizes everyone's participation, regardless of skill level, while still retaining unique elements of strategy. Everyone is encouraged to enter! (Unless you smell bad or something...)

The rules will be similar to those of the U.P.S and D.O.W.N.S. tournament series. But please actually review the rules before registering or submitting files.

Like before, the only selectable songs in this tournament will be those from a special custom pack. The contents of this pack will be determined entirely by the tournament entrants. Here's how it works:

If you preregister before December 1st, you are allowed to submit up to three of your own home-made custom simfiles. The simfiles must also be submitted before before EOD December 1st. Then all of the submitted simfiles will be accumulated and distributed as a whole sometime soon afterward. You have from then until the date of the tournament to practice the custom simfiles.

Of course, you can still choose to enter after December 1st, but you will not be able to submit any of your own simfiles to the tournament pack.

Note that there is a reduced entry fee for those who preregister before December 1st.



# Simfile Guidelines

**HEY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY READ THIS BEFORE MAKING OR SUBMITTING ANY SIMFILES. YEAH, THAT MEANS YOU.**

If your submissions do not meet the guidelines, they will not be accepted. So if you have any questions, or if the rules are unclear, please ask. 

## RULES

* **The simfile must be less than 3:30.** I don't care how long your OGG/MP3 is (but check the filesize requirement), but the total play time of the file cannot be 3:30 or greater. At all. Double-check by setting LongVerSongSeconds to 210 and making sure it doesn't count as two rounds before submitting your file.

* **The simfile must not be offensive.** Offensive material includes obscene levels of profanity, explicit sexual references, lyrics depicting excessive violence, irritatingly loud and obnoxious noises, and anything else that could offend or disturb others in the surrounding area. Simfiles that do not meet this criteria will be rejected, so please do not spend time working on a submission unless you are confident that it is acceptable. (In addition, any graphics, lyric files, or other additions to the simfile must also be appropriate). If you have any questions about whether a song meets this criteria or not feel free to PM me.

* **The chart must have at least 50 hittable arrows.** An example of an arrow that is not hittable is one that is preceded by a negative BPM/warp. The purpose of this rule is to cut down the chances of players repeatedly tying on a song.

* **The total uncompressed size of all of your three submissions *combined* should be no greater than 25MB.** The tournament pack grows in size every year, and I want to keep it somewhat reasonable. If your simfile includes a video file, you will absolutely need to compress it to meet this requirement.

* **The simfiles should be your own work!** You can't submit somebody else's files. Additionally, you have to actually demonstrate that you put a notable level of effort into creating the file. Copying somebody else's chart and rearranging a few notes here and there or changing the graphics does not qualify as writing your own chart. Parodies are fine, but the entire purpose of allowing user-submitted files is to get new content. If I don't think that your file can stand alone as your own work I will likely not allow it. This is subjective so ask me in advance if you have any questions.

* **You can't resubmit files from previous D.O.W.N.S./U.P.S. tournaments.** This goes without saying.

* **Don't break the machine.** Your simfile must not crash the machine, and you are not allowed to abuse lua to modify configuration settings that persist after the song is complete (for example, you are not allowed to change settings via PREFSMAN). This is quite an extensive topic, so if you have any questions, please ask. SM5 also allows for some pretty hacky things so depending on your implementation, I may or may not allow a file depending on what it's trying to achieve.

* **Videos should be perfectly fine on this machine.** Although, if you'd like to play your files on normal arcade machines, don't use videos in your simfile unless you are positive they won't lag. As a general rule of thumb, I recommend against using videos altogether, but if you do, be sure to keep them short and very low-resolution. I am not aware of all the factors that cause some videos to lag more than others, so use your best discretion, and be aware that just because your file doesn't lag on your laptop doesn't mean it won't lag on a machine.

* **Don't be a pain in the ass.** If your chart has a three-minute intro/outro without any notes, you are being a pain in the ass. If your audio is excessively loud or uncomfortable to listen to, you are being a pain in the ass. If you try to hide inappropriate content in your simfile, you are being a pain in the ass. If you submit borderline-offensive content without PM'ing me first, you are being a pain in the ass. Don't be a pain in the ass. I reserve the right to refuse charts that I feel are breaking this rule.

* **The machine's monitor is Widescreen.** The monitor is a 1920 x 1080, 16:9 monitor. If you are looking to do foreground things, keep this in mind. It'd probably be good if you account for widescreen or you letterbox your fgchanges so that things play out the way you want.

* **Stepmania 5 Specific** As long as you don't do things that break the machine (see the rules above), you can use the following.

    * * **Allowed Notetypes**: Tap, Mine, Fake, Lift*
    * * **Allowed Segments**: Stops, Delays, Warps, Scroll Factor
 * *While lifts are allowed, they are a noteskin dependent thing. Currently the noteskins we use fallback on the default noteskin which can make lifts look pretty wonky.
 * *While attacks were allowed in the past, we've found some game breaking nuances with them and thus will be accepted on a case by case basis.

  * If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Additionally if you come across any bugs, please let us know!
* **ITGMania Specific** You are not allowed to use lua to manipulate timing windows/visual delay.

If one of your simfiles is rejected, you will be allowed to resubmit a corrected version of the rejected file or an entirely new file. You may choose to resubmit after a rejection as many times as you like, up until submissions are closed. However, once a simfile is accepted, it may not be revised or replaced. This means you should sync your files BEFORE giving them to me.



Notwithstanding the aforementioned restrictions, your simfiles can be as easy or hard, plain or gimmicky, slow or fast, or reasonable or ridiculous as you like. Use this to your advantage.

Stepmania 5 is a lot more capable than arcade ITG/Stepmania 3.95 so if you think something might not be allowed then be sure to ask me beforehand. I don't know all the capabilities of SM5 myself so some files might be rejected if I think they might affect the progress of the tournament.

Dan has created a 3.95 --> SM5 Lua Guide which can be found [HERE](https://quietly-turning.github.io/Lua-For-SM5/LuaAPI)

Additionally, you can submit using either .sm or .ssc files (or both!). Keep mind that .ssc will only work for SM5 and not arcade ITG/3.95/OpenITG. I recommend sticking with the .ogg/.sm convention if you're not doing anything SM5 exclusive so that people who aren't running SM5 (which is probably a good majority of people) can still play/practice your charts.

SM5 has a preference for "Quirks Mode" which adds some capability to read xml files. Quirks Mode will be enabled for the tournament so if you'd want, you can create xml that works on arcade ITG as well as SM5. Although it's probably better to just write both lua and xml.

**DOUBLE-CHECK THAT YOUR SIMFILES MEET THE REQUIREMENTS BEFORE SUBMITTING THEM TO ME.**


# Preregistration

**The preregistration deadline is December 1st. You cannot preregister or submit any simfiles past this date.**

To preregister, all you need to do is send me or Nick Wanner $10.00. For those who live in the area, this should be relatively simple. For you out-of-state folks, you have a few options
**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR DISCORD HANDLE WHEN PRE-REGISTERING**
* The first option is to Venmo TheNick at @wannernicholas or me at @CrashCringle

* The second option is to use PayPal. If you link your bank account to your PayPal account or use your PayPal balance, money will not be deducted from the transaction (this means I'll actually get all of the $10.00 you send me, instead of ~$9). Send the payment to dawnguard1234@gmail.com.

* Alternatively, you could mail me the money. If this is what you would prefer, then let me know and I'll PM you my mailing address.

* You could also hunt me down in real life. I exist everywhere on Penn State's campus. I'll also be at RIP 12.5. Honestly, it'll probably be a little difficult to find me unless you're at cabby.

* Finally, you could just have another friend give me money for you. Of course, if you do this, your obligation to pay your friend back is out of my hands.


As done in U.P.S, I will allow people to preregister and submit simfiles without any intention of attending the tournament. However, if you don't come, you're probably really lame, so you should come anyway.

Please note that even though you will be directly sending the money to me, I will not be keeping any amount of it for myself. Everything you send me will go directly into the pot (save for some percentage which will be collected for Jack Houser as a machine-usage fee).

If you have any questions or concerns regarding preregistration, feel free to ask.

You can not preregister more than once.


# Simfile Submission

Once you have preregistered, you may begin submitting simfiles. To submit a simfile, all you have to do is send me the necessary files. To do this, you have several options, including the following

* You can e-mail me the file lamarcooley123@gmail.com. Make sure the subject has something RIGHTS related so I can easily search my mailbox in case I miss it.

* You can upload the file via a site like DropBox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc. and PM me a download link on Facebook or on Discord (CrashCringle#0001)

* If we happen to be friends on some form of social media (like XANGA or MYSPACE), you can send me the files that way.
* You can send a thumb drive to me via carrier pigeon, but I'm probably going to keep the thumb drive, tbh.

As soon as simfile is accepted into the pack, I will post it for download. Please note, however, that I have a life (just kidding) and may take a few days to get around to downloading your file, previewing it, and updating this thread accordingly. This is especially true towards the end of the submission period, when I start receiving 10+ new files a day.

**POSTING IN THE FACEBOOK EVENT IS NOT A SUBMISSION.** These are hard to keep track of. You may post files in the event group, but ALSO PM me a direct link.

About a week after the submission deadline, I will release a finalized tournament pack of all of the accepted simfile submissions.


# Tournament Rules

The tournament will be a standard double-elimination bracket. A few points will be noted

   * Seeding will be based on the order in which people register for the tournament.

   * Tie-breakers will be chosen from the pack using the machine's "Random" feature.

   * The player with the highest final percentage (either passing or failing) wins the song.

   * You may only choose mods that do not disqualify you, with the exception that you also not use turn mods (some other mods such as Simple will also be removed from the mod selection screen).

   * You may not pick a song more than once.

   * You may only pick (or random) amongst the expert singles charts.

   * At the beginning of each match, an intense match of Rock, Paper, Scissors will determine which player chooses his or her preferred pad or song pick order, then the other player decides the remaining option.

   * During a match, you should stay on your side of the pad and not touch your opponent or obstruct his or her field of vision. Verbal distractions are allowed up to the extent that they cannot bother other people in the area. The audience is also allowed (and encouraged) to create verbal distractions.

   * If your opponent fails, you are allowed to play the rest of the song unless otherwise noted.

   * You will be disqualified if you don't show up in time for your match. If you want to get food, check the bracket first and let me know where you'll be. I will try and post a list of upcoming matches on a nearby wall, but you can also could (and should) just ask me in person.

   * Don't fart on your opponent while you're playing. Unless they're into that.

   * You can't use any peripherals or humans as an aide while playing any of the charts. i.e. NO TETRIS DANK STRATS JONX JONES



# Venue Information

There's a convenience store with drinks and snacks in the same building as the machine.

There's an all-you-can-eat Buffet above the room we're having the tournament. It's kinda pricey, dinner is ~$15 for non students and lunch is ~$12

If you get hungry, there is a lot of food downtown which is about a 5 minute walk. There is a Sheetz downtown now as well. Feel free to get food whenever you want, as long as you can get back in time for your match. You can bring food back towards the venue, but **please clean up after yourself** and throw your trash away.

The machine is now permanently located in Rec Room (formerly, we used to move it into this room from another area in the same building). There should be enough space to hangout and watch. At worst you can sit on peoples' laps or something.


# Hotels / Housing / Transportation

There are quite a few hotels which are fairly close by. A lot of the people who went to Penn State have graduated but there are still a few people who may have housing. I'll get more information and post it here sometime later. In the meantime, feel free to ask me any questions.

The closest airport is the University Park Airport which is like a 5-10 minute drive from campus. It's also a fairly small airport.
